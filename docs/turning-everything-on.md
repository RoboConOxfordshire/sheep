# The BrainBox

The BrainBox is the core of the kit which we provide. In it is all of the electronics and software you need to power a robot. Lets start by turning it on. Take a battery from the kit and plug it in, then take a red "power button" and connect that to the **black** connector on the side of the Brain Box.

Pressing the power button will cause the the battery LEDs to light, when the LEDs have a solid colour the brain box has booted up and you can now [connect to it's hotspot](/connecting.html).

# How to turn everything off

When you are done for the day, press the power button, the battery LEDs will make a downward "motion", when they all turn off you may unplug the battery.

:::warning
Unplugging the battery before the status LED turns off will cause the Pi to lose power before it has finished shutting down which could permanently damage its sd card. **Always** wait till all the lights turn off before unplugging power.
